# EpiRecipes-ML
Recipe Classification Project

This project explores the classification of recipes using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset used is from Epicurious, a comprehensive recipe database.

Data Visualization

The dataset was visualized to gain insights into the distribution of ingredients, cooking methods, and dish types.

Machine Learning Models

The following machine learning models were trained and evaluated on the dataset:

Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Naive Bayes
Random Forest
AdaBoost
Decision Tree
Model Evaluation

The performance of each model was evaluated using accuracy and classification reports. The results are presented in a comparison graph to facilitate model selection.

Key Findings

"Logistic Regression, SVM, AdaBoost achieved the highest accuracy of 100%"

Code Organization

The code is organized into the following sections:

Data preprocessing and visualization
Model training and evaluation
Result visualization
Dependencies

Python 3.x
Scikit-learn
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Running the Code

To run the code, simply execute the Python script. The dataset is assumed to be in the same directory as the script. Modify the file path as needed.
